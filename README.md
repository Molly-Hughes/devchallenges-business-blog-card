## Overview

This project is part of a challenge from DevChallenges.io. The goal was to create a responsive Business Blog Card that matches provided designs for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

**Key objectives included:**

- Using HTML to create the basic structure.
- Using CSS for styling and layout.
- Practicing absolute positioning techniques.

This was my first time working with position: absolute. While the basic structure and styling came easily, positioning the overlay image responsively was a real learning curve!

At first, the overlay image would shift unpredictably on different screen sizes. Debugging this helped me better understand how absolutely positioned elements relate to their nearest positioned ancestor.

Overall, I enjoyed this simple yet valuable challenge, and it gave me clear insight into how CSS positioning works in real-world layouts.

### What I learned

- position: absolute; removes an element from the normal document flow, meaning it no longer affects (or is affected by) other elements' positioning.

- An absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (i.e., a parent with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).

- Responsive design needs extra care when mixing absolute positioning with flexible layouts â€” media queries and relative container sizing are key tools.

Going forward, I aim to practice more with complex layouts that involve layered positioning and responsiveness.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
